To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion

### Overview
* iterative algorithm
  - it solves problems by repeating steps over and over.
  - Recursion is a method of problem-solving where you solve smaller instances of the problem until you arrive at a solution.
* An algorithm that follows these rules satisfies the three laws of recursion
  - A recursive algorithm must have a base case
  - A recursive algorithm must change its state and move forward the base case.
  - A recursive algorithm must call itself recursively.
