An algorithm must be seen to be believed

### Search 
* Linear Search
    - Complexity: O(n)
    - Worst case: number of list
    - You should consider using a linear search when your data is not sorted.
    - On average, a linear search will take n/2 steps
* Binary Search
    - Complexity: O(log n)
    - If your data is sorted, you can use a more efficient binary search, which you will learn about shortly
